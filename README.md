# Project 3 @cmda-minor-web Â· 2018-2019
> A project of one week for CERN. ICT-students have been working the back-end for almost the entire school year, our assignment is to create a better front-end focussed on the user and their work-flow.

## The user
The users are the professionals at CERN, so they can actually make sense of the data that comes through. They do repetitive work, for hours they look at the same tables and screens. I can't change their "chores" -as Maarten called them- but I could make the interface more pleasurable, more readable and more interactive. __The case I picked up is to make the interface responsive and more accessible.__
